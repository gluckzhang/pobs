# POBS
Automatic Observability for Dockerized Java Applications

A software system is said to be observable if engineers can get accurate information about its running state in production for all layers of the software stack. Observability does not come for free, especially with virtualization technology and cloud-based architecture. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called POBS, to automatically improve the observability of Dockerized Java applications at three different layers: runtime environment, system calls, and application. POBS is based on the automated transformations of Docker configuration files. Our approach injects additional modules in the production application, in order to provide better observability at different layers of the software stack. We evaluate POBS by applying it on open-source Java applications that are containerized with Docker. Our key result is that 81/114 (71%) of Docker Java containers can be automatically augmented with better observability. The impact of this augmentation on the size of the application image and its memory usage is acceptable for production. We identify directions for future work to address its impact on CPU usage.
